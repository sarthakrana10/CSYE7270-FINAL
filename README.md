## 🎮 Overview

This educational package helps students understand A* pathfinding through hands-on interaction and step-by-step visualization. 

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Hexagonal Grid**: Click to place start/goal positions and walls
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Manually advance through each iteration of the A* algorithm
- **Visual State Tracking**: Color-coded visualization of open list, closed list, and final path
- **Educational Design**: Built specifically for learning, not production use
